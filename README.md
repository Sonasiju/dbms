DBMS PROJECT
   The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to enhance the operational efficiency of healthcare facilities by managing patient appointments, doctor schedules, and user interactions. The system provides an intuitive interface for booking, editing, and deleting appointment slots while offering secure user authentication and role-based access for patients and doctors.


   
Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and powered by a backend comprising PHP and MySQL (via XAMPP), the system automates critical tasks such as slot management and doctor availability scheduling. It allows patients to book appointments with specified doctors based on morning or afternoon availability. Doctors can manage their schedules and view appointment details, ensuring a streamlined and efficientÂ process.
